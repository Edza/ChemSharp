# ChemSharp
This is intended to be a begining to a simple chemistry library for C#. It will contain deifnitions for common elements and their properties.

The aim is for the library to be able to:
- validate chemical symbols
- perform 4 of the basic types of reactions
- validate reaction equations

Chemistry is a discipline full of exceptions and this library does not aim to address these concerns.

As this library progresses it will be added as a public web service API.
